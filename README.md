# PPM-Writer
This is a "Library" to easly write Images into a Netpbm File.

It's in Development, and is not particularly active.
I dont promise that it will work flawlessly, nor that i will continue it.

With that out of the way:

# What is this Projects Goals
- Ease of use
- Portablility
- Not using external Librarys
- Being Hopefully Fast

# What is Implemented?
- P6 (Color up to 255 per Channel), Binary Mode

# What could change with later Updates
- Addition of more Netpbm Formats
- Better Code
- Better Stablility
- Better Portablility

# How to build?
You dont need to build this "Library", all you need to do is to include "writer.c" and use its functions accordingly.
An example is provided at "main.c".

Its tested to compile with GCC-13 on ArchLinux.
