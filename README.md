# PPM-Writer
This is a C "Library" to easly write Images into a Netpbm File.

It's in Development, and is not particularly active.
I dont promise that it will work flawlessly, nor that i will continue it.

With that out of the way:

# What is Implemented?
- P6 (Color up to 255 per Channel), Binary Mode

# What could change with later Updates
- Addition of more Netpbm Formats
- Better Code
- Better Stablility
- Better Portablility

# What is this Projects Code-Goals
- Ease of use
- Portablility
- Not using external Librarys
- Being Hopefully

# Fast How to build?
You dont need to build this "Library", all you need to do is to include "writer.c" and use its functions accordingly.
An example is provided at "main.c".

Its tested to compile with GCC-13 on ArchLinux.

# License and Stuff
You can do whatever you want with this Code.
I would appreciate to be given Credit, but its not necessary.
